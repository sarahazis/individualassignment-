            <p>This is my first semester at university. I've gone through various changes and I'm still getting used to them. However, as time goes by, I'm starting to get accustomed to and enjoy the culture here.
			Especially the food, it's really delicious! I give it 10 stars.</p>

            <img src="image/classmatesemtwo.jpg" alt="My Classmate during second sem">
            <p>In the second semester, I started to get close with a female classmate. We began going to classes together, eating together, and completing assignments together.
			 However, this semester surprised my classmates and me because we had to learn about databases. I don't know anything about IT, haha, but fortunately, I have a kind classmate who is willing to help me.

            <img src="image/classmatesemthree.jpg" alt="My Classmate during third sem">
            <p>In the third semester, we learned coding (Python). I understood it a little and could adapt even though I didn't have a coding background. However, our class lecturer is very good and teaches us step by step.
			   Even though there are things we don't understand, we are grateful to be born in the modern era, so we can ask AI.</p>

            <img src="image/classmatesemfour.jpg" alt="My Classmate during fourth sem">
            <p>In the second to last semester, my classmates and I learned about HTML. I thought HTML was very difficult, but it turned out to be easier than coding (Python).
			This is because HTML is simpler and more concise as the words used are abbreviations of longer words.</p>

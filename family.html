    <h1><b>Azis and Julia Family</b></h1>

    <h2><p>
        These are my parents. They come from different ethnic backgrounds. My mother, Julia, is Bajau, while my father, Azis, is Suluk. My father is from Tawau and has 10 siblings, while my mother is from Kunak and has 6 siblings.
        My parents were born and raised in Sabah. My father was a primary school teacher but is now retired, and my mother is a housewife.
        These are my siblings. I am the only girl in the family. My eldest brother is Azizul (the one with glasses), the second is Azizil (the tall and thin one), and the third is Azizan (the one who looks a little bit chubby).
        I am the fourth, Alia, and the youngest is my brother, Azam (the one not wearing a songkok).
        My eldest brother has a significant age gap with us, being 13 years older. People often mistake him for my father or my boyfriend, but he is actually my brother.
        Some of them work for companies, and some are self-employed. Two are still continuing their studies. Additionally, the elderly woman is my grandmother or my mother's mother.

    <h1><b>John Weedon Family</b></h1>

    <h2><p>
        This is my father's side of the family, called the John Weedon Family. We always gather together during Eid. We used to return to the village of Sebatik, but since there have been water issues, we rarely go back there.
        Instead, we visit my aunt's house, who is my father's eldest sister, for Eid celebrations. They are all remarkable people with great careers, which inspire me to have the best job like them. My father's family is also very humorous and cheerful, making our time together very warm. My father has 10 siblings because my grandmother remarried after her first husband passed away and was blessed with 9 children, and with her new husband, she had 1 child.

    <h1><b>Joe Bandan Family</b></h1>

    <h2><p>
        This is my mother's side of the family, known as the Joe Family. Although they rarely gather together due to work commitments, this does not weaken their bond.
        However, when it comes to my mother's family, our gatherings are livelier, especially with my mother's cousins, since almost all of our relatives live in the same district. It's not uncommon for me to attend school or be in the same class with my cousins because our grandfather or great-grandfather had many wives.
        So, whenever there is a family day or an event, it is always lively due to their presence.

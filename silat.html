<h2><p>
I started holding silat in the first semester because I was very interested in self-defense training.   
Besides, I was inspired by my male cousin because he made a silat presentation at his sister's wedding.   
I used to be a techwando member, but since our teacher moved to a another place, we decided to stop because no one could send me there all weekend.

<h2><p>
The silat I follow is the Cekak silat, which is a combat silat.
We're trained to 99% wait for the attack of the 1% attack, all our movements according to human will or in other words according to the movement of the prayer and
we have 4 methods and <i>21 buah</i> movements that different every level.
If you curious about what kind <i>21 buah</i> we learn, you click this <a href="https://www.silatcekak.org.my/matapelajaran/">"Matapelajaran Seni Silat Cekak Malaysia"</a>

When I got into the silat, I thought we were gonna only have a workout, but I was wrong. 
The association is more than just teaching us to defend ourselves in our soft skills by holding a variety of programs either formal or casual.
I love the teachers and the other silatists because they're like my family. I learned a lot of new skills when I joined PSSCM. 
The video above is a celebration program with counsellors, teachers and teachers.
